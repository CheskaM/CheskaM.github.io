ðŸ“¦ Update Your GitHub Page
This is the coding deliverable for Module 1. This must be completed and submitted by the due date.

Instructions:
Using the concepts we've covered in this module, make the following updates to your Resume repo that you've hosted using GitHub Pages.

1.Create a new html page called resume.html
2.Copy and Paste the content of index.html into resume.html
3.Create a folder named css in the root level of your project and move your current css file into that folder
4.Inside that folder, create a CSS file name index.css
5.Update the paths that links the CSS to your pages. Please refer to the "Understanding Relative vs Absolute Paths" lesson in Module 1 if you are unsure of this step.
6.In index.html, create the content that would attract a potential employer or fellow developer.
7.In index.css , write the CSS to be mobile-first and include a media query for your site that will adjust your desired layout from a mobile sized screen to a desktop sized screen (use Flexbox and/or Grid where it is appropriate.)

Note
Building out a wireframe before working on your content and style will help.
